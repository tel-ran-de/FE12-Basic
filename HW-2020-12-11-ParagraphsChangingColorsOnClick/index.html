    Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs.<br>
    Next Door’s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (“Won’t!”).<br>
    Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the<br>
    living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:
</p>
<p>
    “And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation’s owls have been<br>
    behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever<br>
    seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in<br>
    every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly<br>
    changed their sleeping pattern.” The newscaster allowed himself a grin. “Most mysterious.<br>
    And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?”
</p>
<p>
    “Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t know about that, but it’s not only the owls that have<br>
    been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning<br>
    in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars!<br>
    Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early — it’s not until next week, folks!<br>
    But I can promise a wet night tonight.”
